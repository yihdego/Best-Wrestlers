	<p>In Japan there is a group of foreigners who play the bad guys, using American tropes very much akin to 90's Attitude era wrestling. They are the Bullet Club and when they're performing in Japan they put on great shows. There current leader is Kenny Omega. He is playing the challenger to the best belt in Japan and together with IGWP Champian Kazuchika Okada they have put on 2 of the highest rated wrestling matches ever in the span of a year.</p>
