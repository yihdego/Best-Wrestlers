	<h2>AJ Styles</h2>
	<p>My opinion, WWE wrestler AJ Styles is the best preformer in the western hemisphere. His career is has quite long, from the indy scene, to carrying the TNA brand, a wrestling promotion not as big as WWE but on television, to being the best American born wrestler in Japan and now the most exciting thing on WWE Televsion.</p>
