		<h1>Best wrestlers performing today</h1>
		<p>Wrestlers today are more than muscles and a look. Now a days, preformers are also expected to be atheletic and put on death defying stunts akin to special effects in a hollywood movie. I decided to highlight two of my favorite wrestlers who are putting on amazing wrestling shows</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<ul>
			<li>Wrestling is about telling a story.</li>
			<li>Wrestlers put their life on the line pulling off stunts to amaze their audience.</li>
			<li>A good sells to the audience the effectiveness of their opponents move.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>

		<p>When you think of wrestling you're probably thinking of Hulk Hogan, Stone Cold Steve Austin, The Rock! These guys are different. They atheletic without the steriod or body builder look. They move fast and let their fists do the talking.</p>

		<p>After making my website I visted <a href="wwe.com">wwe.com</a>. I actually ended up recognizing a lot of the source code of <a href="wwe.com">wwe.com</a>. They have lists, articles and menu options that a fan can click and play with that given more time I would try to emulate. Something I didn't recognize was the meta tags near the top. Maybe that is css, my partner duing a peer pairing mentioned how most websites use that to look nice.</p>
